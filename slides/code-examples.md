Rust: the compiler

```text
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `s1`
 --> src/main.rs:5:28
  |
3 |     let s2 = s1;
  |         -- value moved here
4 |
5 |     println!("{}, world!", s1);
  |                            ^^ value used here after move
  |
= "note": move occurs because `s1` has type `std::string::String`, which does
  not implement the `Copy` trait
```
